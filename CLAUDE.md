# PROJECT IRONCLAD — Build Instructions for Claude Code

IronClad recreates the single-asset commercial cash flow, valuation, and reporting engine of
ARGUS Enterprise 11.0 (office / industrial / retail, US-style DCF) as a Python calculation
engine + FastAPI + Streamlit web app with Excel export.

**The full build specification is [ARGUS_REBUILD_SPEC.md](ARGUS_REBUILD_SPEC.md). Read it before
any non-trivial task. This file is the standing orders; the spec is the law.**

## The Three Iron Rules

1. **Engine code never imports UI code.** `engine/` is a standalone, headless calculation
   package. It must never import from `ui/`, `api/`, or Streamlit/FastAPI/Plotly. The UI and
   API are clients of the engine, never the reverse.
2. **No phase advances until its golden-file gate passes.** Each roadmap phase (spec §10) has
   an acceptance gate against real ARGUS output exports in `tests/golden/`. Do not start work
   belonging to phase N+1 until phase N's gate passes (tolerances per spec §9.1: line items
   within $1/month, IRR within 1bp, PV within $100). In particular: no UI work until golden
   test #1 passes end-to-end; no report work beyond Cash Flow until golden test #2 passes.
3. **Every calc module gets unit tests from the manual's worked examples.** Each module in
   `engine/calc/` ships with pytest tests reproducing the ARGUS manual's worked examples
   (base rent calc examples, rent reviews, repeating payments, recovery gross-up, resale
   methods — see spec §9.2), **with the manual page citation in each test's docstring**
   (e.g., `"""Rental Income worked example [AE p. 391]."""`).

## Authoritative Reference

`reference/Argus_Training_Guide.pdf` (ARGUS Enterprise 11.0 Product User Manual, 1,056 pp.)
is the **authoritative behavioral reference**. The spec cites it throughout as `[AE pp. x-y]`;
when the spec and the manual conflict on calculation behavior, **the manual governs**. Consult
the cited pages before implementing any calc module. The manual is a reference for functional
behavior only — never copy its text into the product, UI, or docs, and never name or market
the product as "Argus." Do not implement `.aeex`/`.aeix` binary formats; our format is open
JSON (`.icprop.json`, spec §5.1).

## Architecture (spec §2)

- **Stack:** Python 3.11+ engine (`numpy`/`pandas`), `pydantic` v2 input models, JSON-per-property
  persistence + SQLite index (`sqlmodel`), FastAPI API layer, Streamlit UI (v1), Plotly charts,
  `xlsxwriter`/`openpyxl` Excel export, `pytest` + golden-file fixtures.
- **Layout:** `engine/models/` (§3 pydantic input schema) · `engine/calc/` (calculation passes,
  one module per domain: timeline, inflation, leases, recoveries, percentage_rent, revenues,
  expenses, vacancy, absorption, debt, resale, valuation, sensitivity, ledger, run) ·
  `engine/reports/` (DataFrame builders) · `engine/export/` (Excel packages) · `api/` · `ui/` ·
  `data/properties/` + `data/templates/` · `tests/unit/` + `tests/golden/`.
- **The canonical ledger (§2.3):** everything is computed monthly into one pandas DataFrame
  (Period[M] index, analysis begin → end + 12 months for the resale look-forward), one column
  per account in the Chart of Accounts tree. Annual/quarterly/fiscal views are aggregations of
  the monthly ledger, never separately computed. Line names/order must match the ARGUS Cash
  Flow report so exports diff cleanly.
- **Order of operations (§4.1):** timeline → inflation tables → lease chain resolution →
  base rent/adjustments → expenses → recoveries → % rent → tenant misc → property revenues
  (two-pass for %-of-EGR) → general vacancy & credit loss → capital lines → debt → resale →
  valuation → sensitivity (valuation re-runs must not recompute the ledger).
- **Design principles (§1.3):** engine before UI; everything monthly; no silent numbers (full
  per-tenant/per-month audit detail retained); deterministic; open data.

## Phased Roadmap & Gates (spec §10)

| Phase | Scope | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Scaffold | Repo, §3 pydantic models, JSON round-trip, timeline + inflation modules + tests | Tests pass |
| 1 — Core ledger | Base rent (all unit types, steps, CPI, free rent), expenses, simple net recoveries, occupancy, NOI | **Golden #1** (simple net-lease property) cash flow matches |
| 2 — Market machinery | MLPs, rollover blending, absorption, general vacancy/credit loss offsets, full recovery structures, % rent | **Golden #2** (office w/ rollover + base-year) and **#3** (retail) match; Recovery Audit + Lease Audit built and matching |
| 3 — Capital & valuation | TIs/LCs, capex, purchase, debt, resale, PV/IRR, sensitivity | IRR/PV/Resale match goldens; §9.3 invariants pass |
| 4 — Reports & export | Full §7 catalog, PSF toggles, Excel package | Side-by-side export review vs ARGUS prints |
| 5 — UI | Streamlit per §6 | Full property built from scratch through UI only, calc, export |
| 6 — Hardening | Scenario compare, perf (<5s for 100-tenant/10-yr), errors, docs | — |

Refuse scope creep: no hotels, multifamily, UK valuation, portfolio server, budgeting,
multi-currency, GAAP rent, or live-formula Excel before Phase 6 completes (spec §1.2, §11).

## Conventions

- Property invariants (spec §9.3) are asserted on every calc run — PGR identity, occupied ≤
  rentable SF, monthly sums = annual, debt balance rolls, PV/IRR self-consistency.
- Full precision inside the ledger; rounding is report-level only (§4.3).
- Every monetary report respects the Total $ / $ per SF / per-month / per-occupied-SF toggle.
- Run tests: `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest` (Windows). Current status: **Phase 0**.
